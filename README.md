This project applies a wide range of time series forecasting models (from classical statistical methods like ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt-Winters 
to machine learning and deep learning approaches such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, and more). 

The goal is not only to compare model performance, but also to build a hands-on reference for anyone interested in learning how different forecasting techniques are implemented 
and applied to real-world data.
